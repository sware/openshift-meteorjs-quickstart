#Meteor.js on OpenShift

#***Deploy with node-0.6 cartridge
Better success using the node-0.6 cartridge vs the 0.10 one.

Deploy [meteor.js](http://meteor.com/) application bundles on [OpenShift](http://openshift.com/)

If this is your first time using [OpenShift Online](http://openshift.com/) or [Meteor](http://meteor.com/), skip down to the "[Basic Setup Notes](https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/openshift-meteorjs-quickstart#basic-setup-notes)" below.

## Configure your OpenShift gear
Spin up a new OpenShift gear with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), and [a shim to help meteor.js connect to the correct ports](https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/openshift-meteorjs-quickstart).  This example uses the application name: "**meteor**"

    rhc app create meteor nodejs-0.10 mongodb-2.2 --from-code=https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/openshift-meteorjs-quickstart.git

The above command will output a local copy of your OpenShift application source in a folder matching your application name.  Be sure to run this command from within a folder where you would like to keep your project source.

## Create a Meteor.js example project
To see a list of all available meteor.js example projects, type `meteor create --list`.

In this guide, we'll use the meteor.js "leaderboard" example:

    meteor create --example leaderboard

See [http://meteor.com/examples/](http://meteor.com/examples/) to learn about what other example applications are available.  Feel free to try them all.

## Bundle and merge your meteor.js code
Bundle up your meteor.js source:

    cd leaderboard # if you chose the leaderboard example
    meteor bundle bundle.tar.gz # to prep for deployment

Next, you'll need to extract the resulting code into your OpenShift application folder (minus the "bundle/" folder wrapper that Meteor will automatically include). Use the -k flag when extracting to prevent the existing DB connection code from being overwritten during this merge process.

If you are developing on Linux, or using GNU tar, this command should work:

    tar -xvf bundle.tar.gz --transform 's|^bundle/||' -C ../meteor/

For Mac or BSD-based operating systems:

    tar -xvf bundle.tar.gz -s '/^bundle//' -C ../meteor/

The above example assumes that you named your OpenShift application "meteor", as shown in the `rhc app create` step.  And, that your OpenShift application code is available at this relative path: `../meteor`

Add these new files to your OpenShift application's Git repo:

    cd ../meteor
    git add .
    git commit -am "Adding a meteor.js application bundle"

## Deploy to OpenShift
Then, push the new code to OpenShift to deploy your meteor.js application bundle:

    git push

That's it! Check out your new Meteor.js application at:

    http://meteor-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com

## Basic Setup Notes
You'll need an OpenShift Online account, and the `rhc` command-line tools in order to follow this guide.  You'll also need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org), and **Meteor** available in your application developement environment. 

### Installing meteor.js

    curl https://install.meteor.com | sh

### OpenShift Online Setup
In this quickstart guide, we'll be using OpenShift Online to host our application.

Sign up for an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/new

If you don't already have the `rhc` [(Red Hat Cloud) command-line tools](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/get-started#cli), install them:

    sudo gem install rhc

You'll need to run `rhc setup` to link your OpenShift Online account with your local development environment, and to select an application namespace:

    rhc setup

If you need any additional assistance setting up `rhc`, this doc may come in handy: https://openshift.redhat.com/community/developers/rhc-client-tools-install
